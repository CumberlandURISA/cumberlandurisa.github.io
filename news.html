              <h3><a name='GeoTech'></a>10.7.2015: GISP Exam Offered in November for 1st Time</h3>
				The Inaugural GISCI Geospatial Core Technical Knowledge Exam for the GISP Certification will be offered November 12-17, 2015 at PSI testing centers across the US. The exam is a groundbreaking development in the geospatial profession, based upon a complete job analysis from a four-year experience level, informed by the GIS&T Body of Knowledge and guided by the Geospatial Technology Competency Model (GTCM).
				<br>
				<br>
				The Exam and Portfolio Review are offered independently of one another, but both must be completed in order to receive GISP Certification. When you have started with either the Exam or the Portfolio Review, you have up to six (6) years to complete the other before you have to start over.
				<br>
				<br>
				The exam questions will come from the areas of:
				<br>
				<br>
				1. Conceptual Foundations
				<br>
				2. Cartography & Visualization
				<br>
				3. GIS Design Aspects & Data Modeling
				<br>
				4. GIS Analytical Methods
				<br>
				5. Data Manipulation
				<br>
				6. Geospatial Data
				<br>
				<br>
				Although any non-GISP can sign up to take the Inaugural Exam, GISCI is looking for qualified individuals to take the first Exam (those who are able to meet the Portfolio Review requirements at the time of the exam. The application and resume will help us to determine those who are qualified). Existing GISPs are specifically excluded from taking the Exam.
				<br>
				<br>
				For those qualified individuals who complete their Portfolio Review within one year of passing the Exam, GISCI will reimburse the $100 Application Fee and the $100 Portfolio Review Fee as a part of the GISP Certification process.

				Facing increasing regulatory pressures and the continuing inefficiency of paper maps and pens and the wasted hours they caused at all levels of the organization, Owen Electric Cooperative decided to find a better solution.  Their goal was to find a tool which would connect everyone with the same, up-to-date information.  They also wanted that tool to streamline their workflow and enable better response to issues at every level.

              <h3><a name='K12'></a>07.16.2013: Our Position on K-12 Geography Standards in Tennessee</h3>
				The Tennessee State Department of Education has released the final draft of the state <a href="http://www.state.tn.us/education/curriculum.shtml" target='blank'>Social Studies standards</a>. These will be voted on by the State Board of Education on Friday, July 26. If passed, they will be implemented during the 2014/15 academic year. The proposed standards roll geography instruction into hybrid history/geography courses with names like "World History and Geography: The Industrial Revolution to the Contemporary World" and move geography content that is currently in the stand alone 7th grade Social Studies course to the 3rd grade. 
				<br>
				<br>
				It is the opinion of the Cumberland Chapter of URISA that the global economy and society that we live in today actually demands even more rigorous standards for geographic knowledge than what was used in the past. Incorporating geography into history studies falls far short of what is needed by a functioning member of society where location is a key component of governance, marketing and public safety. In addition, a 2012 study by the Boston Consulting Group, commissioned by several members of the Geospatial Industry including National Geographic, Google and ESRI, stated that: the "U.S. geospatial industry generated $73B in revenue last year, with half a million high-wage jobs" as well as "the industry is growing at between 25-30% per year". For Tennessee to benefit from such a high growth, high wage profession, we need to produce high school graduates who are well versed in geography and the geosciences. These new standards will not achieve that.

              <h3><a name='President'></a>Letter From the First President</h3>
				<i>It has been so enjoyable to work with some really smart, dedicated professionals to bring about this newest chapter of <a href="http://www.urisa.org" target='blank'>URISA</a>. Repeatedly, key members of the inaugural board have ask the question "Why should anyone join this Chapter?". This question was not asked in a cynical manner, but instead, it was asked to make sure we knew why we were coming into existence. So, I think I had better explain this "why".
				<br>
				<br>
				From the beginning, we wanted to broaden the conversation about GIS and GeoSpatial Technology to include areas outside of just our two states. There are a lot of issues that are happening across the country that on the surface, may not seem to be relevant to our region. But, the probability is that those issues will be relevant to us eventually. One example is the decision of the California Supreme Court that clarified the definition of GIS. Orange County had claimed that GIS was the data and the software and that you could not separate the two for purpose of meeting the state's public records act. The California State Supreme Court said "NO". It made it clear that spatial data could not be considered the same and part of the software. This case has been in the courts for years and URISA has not only been following it, they have been involved in the debate. Another issue of national discussion is the relationship of Surveyors and GIS professionals. This will come to our states eventually if it hasn't already. Are you familiar with the <a href="http://cdn4.ncees.co/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Model-Law.pdf" target='blank'>NCEES Model Law</a>? URISA was instrumental in getting that model law passed. Do Kentucky and Tennessee follow the model law in their own state laws? Those are questions we need to be asking ourselves. If you deal with addresses and GIS then you may be familiar with the <a href="http://www.fgdc.gov/standards/projects/FGDC-standards-projects/street-address" target='blank'>FGDC</a> addressing standard. Well, URISA was instrumental in developing that standard. Finally, URISA created the first, dedicated professional certification for GIS, the <a href="http://www.gisci.org/Applicants/AbouttheProgram.aspx" target='blank'>GISP</a>. And then, to insure it would be more than just a URISA creation, they formed <a href="http://www.gisci.org/" target='blank'>GISCI</a> and released the GISP to be managed by a collaborative of institutions so that it would truly be a universal professional standard.
				<br>
				<br>
				My point here is to show the variety and depth of the knowledge and resources that a local chapter of URISA can tap into. By joining this chapter you join a national conversation about GIS. We intend to offer educational and networking opportunities that will help us all broaden our horizons and discover better ways of using and managing GIS more effectively while advancing our professional careers.
				<br>
				<br>
				Our goal is not to compete with either the <a href="http://kampro.org/" target='blank'>Kentucky Association of Mapping Professionals</a> or the <a href="http://www.tngic.org/" target='blank'>Tennessee Geographic Information Council</a>. Instead, our goal is to offer services and activities that supplement and complement those existing programs. The Cumberland Chapter of URISA is here to bring a global perspective to local issues.
				<br>
				<br>
				So, how about <a href="membership.html">joining</a> Cumberland URISA and joining the conversation?
